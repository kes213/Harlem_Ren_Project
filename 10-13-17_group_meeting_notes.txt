Harlem Renaissance Project 
Group Meeting Notes


Topics discussed: 
Group reviewed and finalized schema
       possible additions involvong syntax markup for the poems once the rest of the markup is completed
Group finalized the decisions on which group member would work with which poets:
       Kaylee = Claude McKay & Langston Hughes
       Liz = Ann Spencer & Effie Lee Newsome
       Tylar = Anna Bontemps and James Weldon Johnson
Things we'll be marking:
        1) coder (using initials)
        2) header that contains a title and a poet
        3) content that contains the stanzas and lines of the poem
        4) Each line is wrapped with <line> elements with an n attribute to label each line number.
        5) Punctuation
        6) Figurative Language
        7) Theme
        
Deadlines: 
        Each group member will push 20 poems in separate XML documents (10 for each poet) that are marked with the header, title, author, stanza, line,
        punctuation, figurative language, and theme by Friday, October 20. 
        Tylar will push his poems with all of the above except figurative language and theme, which Liz and Kaylee will help him with. Instead, Tylar will
        begin working with biographies of each poet for the HTML website. 
        
        Group members should use the XML document containing Claude McKay's "The Lynching" as a model for their poem markups. Remember to associate the schema
        for every XML document containing a poem! 
        Poems and biographies can be accessed on the Poetry Foundation's website, linked on the original project proposal page and easily accessible by google search.
