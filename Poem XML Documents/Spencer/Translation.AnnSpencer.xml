<stanza>
<l n="1">We trekked into a far country, </l>
<l n="2">My friend and I<punc type="period">.</punc> </l>
<l n="3">Our deeper content was never spoken,</l>
<l n="4">But each knew all the other said<punc type="period">.</punc></l>
<l n="5">He told me how calm his soul was laid</l>
<l n="6">By the lack of anvil and strife.</l>
<l n="7">“The wooing kestrel,” I said, “mutes his mating-note</l>
<l n="8">To please the harmony of this sweet silence.”</l>
<l n="9">And when at the day’s end</l>
<l n="10">We laid tired bodies ’gainst</l>
<l n="11">The loose warm sands,</l>
<l n="12">And the air fleeced its particles for a coverlet<punc type="semicolon">;</punc></l>
<l n="13">When star after star came out</l>
<l n="14">To guard their lovers in oblivion—</l>
<l n="15"><figLang form="personification">My soul so leapt</figLang> that my evening prayer </l>
<l n="16">Stole my morning song! </l>
