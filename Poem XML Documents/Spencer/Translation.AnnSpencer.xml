    <poem>
<stanza n="1">
<line>We trekked into a far country, </line>
<line>My friend and I. </line>
<line>Our deeper content was never spoken,</line>
<line>But each knew all the other said.</line>
<line>He told me how calm his soul was laid</line>
<line>By the lack of anvil and strife.</line>
<line>“The wooing kestrel,” I said, “mutes his mating-note</line>
<line>To please the harmony of this sweet silence.”</line>
<line>And when at the day’s end</line>
<line>We laid tired bodies ’gainst</line>
<line>The loose warm sands,</line>
<line>And the air fleeced its particles for a coverlet;</line>
<line>When star after star came out</line>
<line>To guard their lovers in oblivion—</line>
<line><personif>My soul so leapt</personif> that my evening prayer </line>
<line>Stole my morning song! </line>
