    <poem>
        <stanza n="1">
     <line>If ever a garden was Gethsemane,</line>
    <line>with old tombs set high against</line>
<line> the crumpled olive tree--and lichen,
<line this, my garden, has been to me.
<line>    Lacking old tombs, here stands my grief,
    <line><metaphor>and certainly its ancient tree.</metaphor></line> 
        </stanza>
    
   <stanza n="2">
       
<line>       Peace is here and in every season </line>
<line><metaphor> a quiet beauty.</metaphor> </line>
<line>       The sky falling about me </line>
<line>       evenly to the compass . . .</line>   
   </stanza>
       
       
<stanza n="3">       
<line>    What is sorrow but tenderness now </line>
<line>      in this earth-close frame of land and sky </line>
<line>       falling constantly into horizons</line>
<line>       of east and west, north and south;</line>
<line>what is pain but happiness here></line>
<line> amid these <metaphor>green and wordless patterns,</metaphor>--</line>
<line> indefinite texture of blade and leaf:</line>
       
       <stanza="4">
<line> Beauty of an old, old tree,</line>
<line>last comfort in Gethsemane </line>
       </stanza>.
