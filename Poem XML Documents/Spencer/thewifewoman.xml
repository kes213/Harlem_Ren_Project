   <stanza> Maker-of-<allit>Sevens in the scheme</allit> of things</stanza>
From earth to star;
<line>Thy cycle holds whatever is fate, and</line>
Over the border the bar.
<line>Though rank and fierce<metaphor> the mariner</metaphor></line>
<line>Sailing the seven seas,</line>
<line>He prays as he holds his <consonance>glass to his eyes</consonance>,</line>
<line>Coaxing the <allusion>Pleiades</allusion>.</line></stanza>

<stanza n="2">
   <line> I cannot love them; and I feel your glad,</line>
<line>Chiding from the grave,</line>
<line>That my all was only worth at all, what</line>
<line>Joy to you it gave,</line>
<line>These seven links the Law compelled</line>
<line>For the human chain—</line>
<line>I cannot love them; and you, oh,</line>
<line><consonance>Seven-fold months in Flanders slain!</consonance></line></stanza>

<stanza n="3">
    <line>A jungle there, a cave here, bred six</line>
<line>And a million years.</line>
<line><allit>Sure and strong, mate for mate, such</allit></line>
<line>Love as culture fears;</line>
<line>I gave you clear the oil and wine;</line>
<line>You saved me your hob and hearth—</line>
<line>See how even life may be ere the</line>
<line>Sickle comes and leaves a swath.</line></stanza>

<stanza n="4">
   <line><hyperbole> But I can wait the seven of moons,</hyperbole></line>
<line>Or years I spare,</line>
<line><allit>Hoarding the heart's plenty, nor spend</allit></line>
<line>A drop, nor share—</line>
<line>So long but outlives a smile and</line>
<line>A silken gown;</line>
<line>Then gaily I reach up from my shroud,</line>
<line>And you, glory-clad, reach down. </line></stanza>
