    <line>Black man o' mine,</line>
    <line>As I hush and caress you, close to my heart,</line>
    <line>All your loving is just your needing what is true;</line>
    <line>Then with <metaphor>your passing dark</metaphor> comes my darkest part,</line>
   <line> For living without your love is only rue.</line>
    <line>Black man o' mine, <metaphor>if the world were your lover</metaphor></line>
    <line>It could not give what I give to you.</line>
