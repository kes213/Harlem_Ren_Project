     <line n="1" stanza="1">Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank,</line>
    <line n="2" stanza="1">I desire a name for you</line>
   <line n="3" stanza="1">Nice, as a right glove fits;</line>
    <line n="4" stanza="1">For you—who amid the malodorous</line>
    <line n="5" stanza="1">Mechanics of this unlovely thing,</line>
    <line n="6" stanza="1">Are darling of spirit and form.</line>
    <line n="7" stanza="1">I know you—a glance, and what you are</line>
    <line n="8" stanza="1">Sits-by-the-fire in my heart.</line>
    <line n="9" stanza="1">My Limousine-Lady knows you, or</line>
    <line n="10" stanza="1">Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark</line>
    <line n="11" stanza="1">Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile?</line>
    <line n="12" stanza="1">Guilt pins a fig-leaf; Innocence is its own adorning.</line>
    <line n="13" stanza="1">The bull-necked man knows you—this first time</line>
  <line n="14" stanza="1">His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health</line>
  <line n="15" stanza="1">And thinks not of his avocation.</line>
    <line n="16" stanza="1">I came incuriously—</line>
    <line n="17" stanza="1">Set on no diversion save that my mind</line>
    <line n="18" stanza="1">Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds</line>
    <line n="19" stanza="1">In the presence of a blind crowd</line>
   <line n="20" stanza="1">The color of life was gray.</line>
    <line n="21" stanza="1">Everywhere the setting seemed right</line>
    <line n="22" stanza="1">For my mood. </line>
    <line n="23" stanza="1">Here the sausage and garlic booth</line>
    <line n="24" stanza="1">Sent unholy incense skyward;</line>
   <line n="25" stanza="1">There a quivering female-thing</line>
    <line n="26" stanza="1">Gestured assignations, and lied</line>
   <line n="27" stanza="1">To call it dancing;</line>
    <line n="28" stanza="1">There, too, were games of chance</line>
    <line n="29" stanza="1">With chances for none;</line>
    <line n="30" stanza="1">But oh! Girl-of-the-Tank, at last!</line>
    <line n="31" stanza="1">Gleaming Girl, how intimately pure and free</line>
    <line n="32" stanza="1">The gaze you send the crowd,</line>
    <line n="33" stanza="1">As though you know the dearth of beauty</line>
    <line n="34" stanza="1">In its sordid life.</line>
    <line n="35" stanza="1">We need you—my Limousine-Lady,</line>
    <line n="36" stanza="1">The bull-necked man and I.</line>
    <line n="37" stanza="1">Seeing you here brave and water-clean,</line>
    <line n="38" stanza="1">Leaven for the heavy ones of earth,</line>
    <line n="39" stanza="1">I am swift to feel that what makes</line>
  <line n="40" stanza="1">The plodder glad is good; and</line>
    <line n="41" stanza="1">Whatever is good is God.</line>
   <line n="42" stanza="1">The wonder is that you are here</line>
   <line n="43" stanza="1">I have seen the queer in queer places,</line>
    <line n="44" stanza="1">But never before a heaven-fed</line>
   <line n="45" stanza="1">Naiad of the Carnival-Tank!</line>
   <line n="46" stanza="1">Little Diver, Destiny for you,</line>
    <line n="47" stanza="1">Like as for me, is shod in silence;</line>
    <line n="48" stanza="1">Years may seep into your soul</line>
    <line n="49" stanza="1">The bacilli of the usual and the expedient;</line>
    <line n="50" stanza="1">I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day! </line>
