        <stanza n="1">
      <line><allit>Gay little Girl</allit>-of-the-Diving-Tank,</line>
    <line>I desire a name for you</line>,
   <line> Nice, as a right glove fits;</line>
    <line>For you—who amid the malodorous</line>
    <line>Mechanics of this unlovely thing,</line>
    <line>Are darling of spirit and form.</line>
    <line>I know you—a glance, and what you are</line>
    <line><metaphor>Sits-by-the-fire in my heart.</metaphor></line>
    <line>My Limousine-Lady knows you, or</line>
    <line><imagery>Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark</imagery></line>
    <line><imagery>Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile?</imagery></line>
    <line>Guilt pins a fig-leaf; Innocence is its own adorning.</line>
    <line>The bull-necked man knows you—this first time</line>
  <line>  His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health</line>
  <line>  And thinks not of his avocation.</line>
    <line>I came incuriously—</line>
    <line>Set on no diversion save that my mind</line>
    <line><personif>Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds</personif></line>
    <line>In the presence of a blind crowd</line>.
   <line> The color of life was gray.</line>
    <line>Everywhere the setting seemed right</line>
    <line>For my mood. </line>
    <line>Here the sausage and garlic booth</line>
    <line>Sent unholy incense skyward;</line>
   <line> There a quivering female-thing</line>
    <line>Gestured assignations, and lied</line>
   <line> To call it dancing;</line>
    <line><metaphor>There, too, were games of chance</metaphor></line>
    <line>With chances for none;</line>
    <line>But oh! Girl-of-the-Tank, at last!</line>
    <line><allit>Gleaming Girl,</allit> how intimately pure and free</line>
    <line>The gaze you send the crowd,</line>
    <line>As though you know the dearth of beauty</line>
    <line>In its sordid life.</line>
    <line>We need you—my Limousine-Lady,</line>
    <line>The bull-necked man and I.</line>
    <line>Seeing you here brave and water-clean,</line>
    <line>Leaven for the heavy ones of earth,</line>
    <line>I am swift to feel that what makes</line>
  <line>  The plodder glad is good; and</line>
    <line><allit>Whatever is good is God.</allit></line>
   <line> The wonder is that you are here</line>;
   <line> I have seen the queer in queer places,</line>
    <line>But never before a heaven-fed</line>
   <line> Naiad of the Carnival-Tank!</line>
   <line> Little Diver, Destiny for you,</line>
    <line>Like as for me, is shod in silence;</line>
    <line><allit>Years may seep into your soul</allit></line>
    <line>The bacilli of the usual and the expedient;</line>
    <line><allusion>I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day! </allusion></line>
