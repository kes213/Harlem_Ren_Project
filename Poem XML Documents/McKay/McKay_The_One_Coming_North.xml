    To One Coming North 
    By Claude McKay 
    At first you'll joy to see the playful snow<punc>,</punc> 
      Like white moths trembling on the tropic air<punc>,</punc> 
    Or waters of the hills that softly flow 
      Gracefully falling down a shining stair<punc>.</punc>
     
    And when the fields and streets are covered white 
      And the wind-worried void is chilly<punc>,</punc> raw<punc>,</punc> 
    Or underneath a spell of heat and light 
      The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw<punc>,</punc>
     
    Like me you'll long for home<punc>,</punc> where birds' glad song 
      Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry<punc>,</punc> 
    And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong<punc>,</punc> 
      Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky<punc>.</punc>
     
    But oh<punc>!</punc> more than the changeless southern isles<punc>,</punc> 
      When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm<punc>,</punc> 
    You'll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles 
      By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm<punc>.</punc>
