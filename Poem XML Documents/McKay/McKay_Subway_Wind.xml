    Subway Wind 
    By Claude McKay 
    Far down<punc>,</punc> down through the city’s great gaunt gut
          The gray train rushing bears the weary wind<punc>;</punc>
    In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut<punc>,</punc>
          Leaving the sick and heavy air behind<punc>.</punc>
    And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door
          To give their summer jackets to the breeze<punc>;</punc>
    Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar
          Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas<punc>;</punc>
    Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift
          Through sleepy waters<punc>,</punc> while gulls wheel and sweep<punc>,</punc>
    Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift
          Lightly among the islands of the deep<punc>;</punc>
    Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white
          That led their perfume to the tropic sea<punc>,</punc>
    Where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night<punc>,</punc>
          And the Trades float above them fresh and free<punc>.</punc>
