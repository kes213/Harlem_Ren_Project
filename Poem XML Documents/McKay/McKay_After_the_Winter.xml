    After the Winter 
    By Claude McKay 
    Some day<punc>,</punc> when trees have shed their leaves
         And against the morning’s white
    The shivering birds beneath the eaves
         Have sheltered for the night<punc>,</punc>
    We’ll turn our faces southward<punc>,</punc> love<punc>,</punc>
         Toward the summer isle
    Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
         And wide-mouthed orchids smile<punc>.</punc>
    
    And we will seek the quiet hill
         Where towers the cotton tree<punc>,</punc>
    And leaps the laughing crystal rill<punc>,</punc>
         And works the droning bee<punc>.</punc>
    And we will build a cottage there
         Beside an open glade<punc>,</punc>
    With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near<punc>,</punc>
         And ferns that never fade<punc>.</punc>
