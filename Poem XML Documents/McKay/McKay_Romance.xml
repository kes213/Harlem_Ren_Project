    Romance 
    By Claude McKay 
    To clasp you now and feel your head close-pressed<punc>,</punc> 
    Scented and warm against my beating breast<punc>;</punc> 
    
    To whisper soft and quivering your name<punc>,</punc> 
    And drink the passion burning in your frame<punc>;</punc> 
    
    To lie at full length<punc>,</punc> taut<punc>,</punc> with cheek to cheek<punc>,</punc> 
    And tease your mouth with kisses till you speak 
    
    Love words<punc>,</punc> mad words<punc>,</punc> dream words<punc>,</punc> sweet senseless words<punc>,</punc> 
    Melodious like notes of mating birds<punc>;</punc> 
    
    To hear you ask if I shall love always<punc>,</punc> 
    And myself answer<punc>:</punc> Till the end of days<punc>;</punc> 
    
    To feel your easeful sigh of happiness 
    When on your trembling lips I murmur<punc>:</punc> Yes<punc>;</punc> 
    
    It is so sweet<punc>.</punc> We know it is not true<punc>.</punc> 
    What matters it<punc>?</punc> The night must shed her dew<punc>.</punc> 
    
    We know it is not true<punc>,</punc> but it is sweetâ€” 
    The poem with this music is complete<punc>.</punc>
