    Harlem Shadows 
    By Claude McKay 
    I hear the halting footsteps of a lass 
    In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall 
    Its veil<punc>.</punc> I see the shapes of girls who pass 
    To bend and barter at desire's call<punc>.</punc> 
    Ah<punc>,</punc> little dark girls who in slippered feet 
    Go prowling through the night from street to street<punc>!</punc> 
    
    Through the long night until the silver break 
    Of day the little gray feet know no rest<punc>;</punc> 
    Through the lone night until the last snow-flake 
    Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast<punc>,</punc> 
    The dusky<punc>,</punc> half-clad girls of tired feet 
    Are trudging<punc>,</punc> thinly shod<punc>,</punc> from street to street<punc>.</punc> 
    
    Ah<punc>,</punc> stern harsh world<punc>,</punc> that in the wretched way 
    Of poverty<punc>,</punc> dishonor and disgrace<punc>,</punc> 
    Has pushed the timid little feet of clay<punc>,</punc> 
    The sacred brown feet of my fallen race<punc>!</punc> 
    Ah<punc>,</punc> heart of me<punc>,</punc> the weary<punc>,</punc> weary feet 
    In Harlem wandering from street to street<punc>.</punc>
