<poem>
    America 
    By Claude McKay 
    Although she feeds me bread of bitterness<punc>,</punc> 
    And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth<punc>,</punc> 
    Stealing my breath of life<punc>,</punc> I will confess 
    I love this cultured hell that tests my youth<punc>.</punc> 
    Her vigor flows like tides into my blood<punc>,</punc> 
    Giving me strength erect against her hate<punc>,</punc> 
    Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood<punc>.</punc> 
    Yet<punc>,</punc> as a rebel fronts a king in state<punc>,</punc> 
    I stand within her walls with not a shred 
    Of terror<punc>,</punc> malice<punc>,</punc> not a word of jeer<punc>.</punc> 
    Darkly I gaze into the days ahead<punc>,</punc> 
    And see her might and granite wonders there<punc>,</punc> 
    Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand<punc>,</punc> 
    Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand<punc>.</punc>
