After the Winter 
By Claude McKay 
Some day<punc>,</punc> when trees have shed their leaves
     And against the morning’s white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
     Have sheltered for the night<punc>,</punc>
We’ll turn our faces southward<punc>,</punc> love<punc>,</punc>
     Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
     And wide-mouthed orchids smile<punc>.</punc>

And we will seek the quiet hill
     Where towers the cotton tree<punc>,</punc>
And leaps the laughing crystal rill<punc>,</punc>
     And works the droning bee<punc>.</punc>
And we will build a cottage there
     Beside an open glade<punc>,</punc>
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near<punc>,</punc>
     And ferns that never fade<punc>.</punc>

Harlem Shadows 
By Claude McKay 
I hear the halting footsteps of a lass 
In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall 
Its veil<punc>.</punc> I see the shapes of girls who pass 
To bend and barter at desire's call<punc>.</punc> 
Ah<punc>,</punc> little dark girls who in slippered feet 
Go prowling through the night from street to street<punc>!</punc> 

Through the long night until the silver break 
Of day the little gray feet know no rest<punc>;</punc> 
Through the lone night until the last snow-flake 
Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast<punc>,</punc> 
The dusky<punc>,</punc> half-clad girls of tired feet 
Are trudging<punc>,</punc> thinly shod<punc>,</punc> from street to street<punc>.</punc> 

Ah<punc>,</punc> stern harsh world<punc>,</punc> that in the wretched way 
Of poverty<punc>,</punc> dishonor and disgrace<punc>,</punc> 
Has pushed the timid little feet of clay<punc>,</punc> 
The sacred brown feet of my fallen race<punc>!</punc> 
Ah<punc>,</punc> heart of me<punc>,</punc> the weary<punc>,</punc> weary feet 
In Harlem wandering from street to street<punc>.</punc>

America 
By Claude McKay 
Although she feeds me bread of bitterness<punc>,</punc> 
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth<punc>,</punc> 
Stealing my breath of life<punc>,</punc> I will confess 
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth<punc>.</punc> 
Her vigor flows like tides into my blood<punc>,</punc> 
Giving me strength erect against her hate<punc>,</punc> 
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood<punc>.</punc> 
Yet<punc>,</punc> as a rebel fronts a king in state<punc>,</punc> 
I stand within her walls with not a shred 
Of terror<punc>,</punc> malice<punc>,</punc> not a word of jeer<punc>.</punc> 
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead<punc>,</punc> 
And see her might and granite wonders there<punc>,</punc> 
Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand<punc>,</punc> 
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand<punc>.</punc>

If We Must Die 
By Claude McKay 
If we must die<punc>,</punc> let it not be like hogs
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot<punc>,</punc>
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs<punc>,</punc>
Making their mock at our accursèd lot<punc>.</punc>
If we must die<punc>,</punc> O let us nobly die<punc>,</punc>
So that our precious blood may not be shed
In vain<punc>;</punc> then even the monsters we defy
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead<punc>!</punc>
O kinsmen<punc>!</punc> we must meet the common foe<punc>!</punc>
Though far outnumbered let us show us brave<punc>,</punc>
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow<punc>!</punc>
What though before us lies the open grave<punc>?</punc>
Like men we’ll face the murderous<punc>,</punc> cowardly pack<punc>,</punc>
Pressed to the wall<punc>,</punc> dying<punc>,</punc> but fighting back<punc>!</punc>

Joy in the Woods 
By Claude McKay 
There is joy in the woods just now<punc>,</punc>
       The leaves are whispers of song<punc>,</punc>
And the birds make mirth on the bough
       And music the whole day long<punc>,</punc>
And God<punc>!</punc> to dwell in the town
       In these springlike summer days<punc>,</punc>
On my brow an unfading frown
       And hate in my heart always—

A machine out of gear<punc>,</punc> aye<punc>,</punc> tired<punc>,</punc>
Yet forced to go on—for I’m hired<punc>.</punc>

Just forced to go on through fear<punc>,</punc>
       For every day I must eat
And find ugly clothes to wear<punc>,</punc>
       And bad shoes to hurt my feet
And a shelter for work-drugged sleep<punc>!</punc>
       A mere drudge<punc>!</punc> but what can one do<punc>?</punc>
A man that’s a man cannot weep<punc>!</punc>
       Suicide<punc>?</punc> A quitter<punc>?</punc> Oh<punc>,</punc> no<punc>!</punc>

But a slave should never grow tired<punc>,</punc>
Whom the masters have kindly hired<punc>.</punc>

But oh<punc>!</punc> for the woods<punc>,</punc> the flowers
       Of natural<punc>,</punc> sweet perfume<punc>,</punc>
The heartening<punc>,</punc> summer showers
       And the smiling shrubs in bloom<punc>,</punc>
Dust-free<punc>,</punc> dew-tinted at morn<punc>,</punc>
       The fresh and life-giving air<punc>,</punc>
The billowing waves of corn
       And the birds’ notes rich and clear<punc>:</punc>—

For a man-machine toil-tired
May crave beauty too—though he’s hired<punc>.</punc>

Romance 
By Claude McKay 
To clasp you now and feel your head close-pressed<punc>,</punc> 
Scented and warm against my beating breast<punc>;</punc> 

To whisper soft and quivering your name<punc>,</punc> 
And drink the passion burning in your frame<punc>;</punc> 

To lie at full length<punc>,</punc> taut<punc>,</punc> with cheek to cheek<punc>,</punc> 
And tease your mouth with kisses till you speak 

Love words<punc>,</punc> mad words<punc>,</punc> dream words<punc>,</punc> sweet senseless words<punc>,</punc> 
Melodious like notes of mating birds<punc>;</punc> 

To hear you ask if I shall love always<punc>,</punc> 
And myself answer<punc>:</punc> Till the end of days<punc>;</punc> 

To feel your easeful sigh of happiness 
When on your trembling lips I murmur<punc>:</punc> Yes<punc>;</punc> 

It is so sweet<punc>.</punc> We know it is not true<punc>.</punc> 
What matters it<punc>?</punc> The night must shed her dew<punc>.</punc> 

We know it is not true<punc>,</punc> but it is sweet— 
The poem with this music is complete<punc>.</punc>

To One Coming North 
By Claude McKay 
At first you'll joy to see the playful snow<punc>,</punc> 
  Like white moths trembling on the tropic air<punc>,</punc> 
Or waters of the hills that softly flow 
  Gracefully falling down a shining stair<punc>.</punc>
 
And when the fields and streets are covered white 
  And the wind-worried void is chilly<punc>,</punc> raw<punc>,</punc> 
Or underneath a spell of heat and light 
  The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw<punc>,</punc>
 
Like me you'll long for home<punc>,</punc> where birds' glad song 
  Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry<punc>,</punc> 
And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong<punc>,</punc> 
  Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky<punc>.</punc>
 
But oh<punc>!</punc> more than the changeless southern isles<punc>,</punc> 
  When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm<punc>,</punc> 
You'll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles 
  By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm<punc>.</punc>

On Broadway 
By Claude McKay 
About me young careless feet 
Linger along the garish street<punc>;</punc> 
Above<punc>,</punc> a hundred shouting signs 
Shed down their bright fantastic glow 
Upon the merry crowd and lines 
Of moving carriages below<punc>.</punc> 
Oh wonderful is Broadway — only 
My heart<punc>,</punc> my heart is lonely<punc>.</punc> 

Desire naked<punc>,</punc> linked with Passion<punc>,</punc> 
Goes trutting by in brazen fashion<punc>;</punc> 
From playhouse<punc>,</punc> cabaret and inn 
The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze 
All gay without<punc>,</punc> all glad within<punc>;</punc> 
As in a dream I stand and gaze 
At Broadway<punc>,</punc> shining Broadway — only 
My heart<punc>,</punc> my heart is lonely<punc>.</punc>

December<punc>,</punc> 1919 
By Claude McKay 
Last night I heard your voice<punc>,</punc> mother<punc>,</punc> 
The words you sang to me 
When I<punc>,</punc> a little barefoot boy<punc>,</punc> 
Knelt down against your knee<punc>.</punc> 

And tears gushed from my heart<punc>,</punc> mother<punc>,</punc> 
And passed beyond its wall<punc>,</punc> 
But though the fountain reached my throat 
The drops refused to fall<punc>.</punc> 

'Tis ten years since you died<punc>,</punc> mother<punc>,</punc> 
Just ten dark years of pain<punc>,</punc> 
And oh<punc>,</punc> I only wish that I 
Could weep just once again<punc>.</punc>

Subway Wind 
By Claude McKay 
Far down<punc>,</punc> down through the city’s great gaunt gut
      The gray train rushing bears the weary wind<punc>;</punc>
In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut<punc>,</punc>
      Leaving the sick and heavy air behind<punc>.</punc>
And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door
      To give their summer jackets to the breeze<punc>;</punc>
Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar
      Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas<punc>;</punc>
Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift
      Through sleepy waters<punc>,</punc> while gulls wheel and sweep<punc>,</punc>
Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift
      Lightly among the islands of the deep<punc>;</punc>
Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white
      That led their perfume to the tropic sea<punc>,</punc>
Where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night<punc>,</punc>
      And the Trades float above them fresh and free<punc>.</punc>
</poem>
