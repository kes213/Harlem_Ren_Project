<poem>
    On Broadway 
    By Claude McKay 
    About me young careless feet 
    Linger along the garish street<punc>;</punc> 
    Above<punc>,</punc> a hundred shouting signs 
    Shed down their bright fantastic glow 
    Upon the merry crowd and lines 
    Of moving carriages below<punc>.</punc> 
    Oh wonderful is Broadway — only 
    My heart<punc>,</punc> my heart is lonely<punc>.</punc> 
    
    Desire naked<punc>,</punc> linked with Passion<punc>,</punc> 
    Goes trutting by in brazen fashion<punc>;</punc> 
    From playhouse<punc>,</punc> cabaret and inn 
    The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze 
    All gay without<punc>,</punc> all glad within<punc>;</punc> 
    As in a dream I stand and gaze 
    At Broadway<punc>,</punc> shining Broadway — only 
    My heart<punc>,</punc> my heart is lonely<punc>.</punc>
