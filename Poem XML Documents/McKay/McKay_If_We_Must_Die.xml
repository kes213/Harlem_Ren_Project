    If We Must Die 
    By Claude McKay 
    If we must die<punc>,</punc> let it not be like hogs
    Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot<punc>,</punc>
    While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs<punc>,</punc>
    Making their mock at our accursèd lot<punc>.</punc>
    If we must die<punc>,</punc> O let us nobly die<punc>,</punc>
    So that our precious blood may not be shed
    In vain<punc>;</punc> then even the monsters we defy
    Shall be constrained to honor us though dead<punc>!</punc>
    O kinsmen<punc>!</punc> we must meet the common foe<punc>!</punc>
    Though far outnumbered let us show us brave<punc>,</punc>
    And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow<punc>!</punc>
    What though before us lies the open grave<punc>?</punc>
    Like men we’ll face the murderous<punc>,</punc> cowardly pack<punc>,</punc>
    Pressed to the wall<punc>,</punc> dying<punc>,</punc> but fighting back<punc>!</punc>
