      <h2>Subway Wind</h2>
      <p>
            Far down, down through the city’s great gaunt gut<br/>
            The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;<br/>
            In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut,<br/>
            Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.<br/>
            And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door<br/>
            To give their summer jackets to the breeze;<br/>
            Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar<br/>
            Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas;<br/>
            Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift<br/>
            Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,<br/>
            Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift<br/>
            Lightly among the islands of the deep;<br/>
            Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white<br/>
            That led their perfume to the tropic sea,<br/>
            Where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night,<br/>
            And the Trades float above them fresh and free.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>On Broadway</h2>
      <p>
            About me young careless feet<br/> 
            Linger along the garish street;<br/> 
            Above, a hundred shouting signs<br/> 
            Shed down their bright fantastic glow<br/> 
            Upon the merry crowd and lines<br/> 
            Of moving carriages below.<br/> 
            Oh wonderful is Broadway — only<br/> 
            My heart, my heart is lonely.<br/>
        <br/>
            Desire naked, linked with Passion,<br/> 
            Goes trutting by in brazen fashion;<br/> 
            From playhouse, cabaret and inn<br/> 
            The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze<br/> 
            All gay without, all glad within;<br/> 
            As in a dream I stand and gaze<br/> 
            At Broadway, shining Broadway — only<br/> 
            My heart, my heart is lonely.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>Romance</h2>
      <p>
            To clasp you now and feel your head close-pressed,<br/> 
            Scented and warm against my beating breast;<br/>
        <br/>
            To whisper soft and quivering your name,<br/> 
            And drink the passion burning in your frame;<br/>
        <br/>
            To lie at full length, taut, with cheek to cheek,<br/> 
            And tease your mouth with kisses till you speak<br/>
        <br/>
            Love words, mad words, dream words, sweet senseless words,<br/> 
            Melodious like notes of mating birds;<br/>
        <br/>
            To hear you ask if I shall love always,<br/> 
            And myself answer: Till the end of days;<br/>
        <br/>
            To feel your easeful sigh of happines<br/>
            When on your trembling lips I murmur: Yes;<br/>
        <br/>
            It is so sweet. We know it is not true.<br/> 
            What matters it? The night must shed her dew.<br/>
        <br/>
            We know it is not true, but it is sweet—<br/> 
            The poem with this music is complete.<br/>
        <br/>

      <h2>America</h2>
      <p>
            Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,<br/> 
            And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,<br/> 
            Stealing my breath of life, I will confess<br/>
            I love this cultured hell that tests my youth.<br/> 
            Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,<br/> 
            Giving me strength erect against her hate,<br/> 
            Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.<br/> 
            Yet, as a rebel fronts a king in state,<br/> 
            I stand within her walls with not a shred<br/> 
            Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.<br/> 
            Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,<br/> 
            And see her might and granite wonders there,<br/> 
            Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,<br/> 
            Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>Joy in the Woods</h2>
      <p>
            There is joy in the woods just now,<br/>
            The leaves are whispers of song,<br/>
            And the birds make mirth on the bough<br/>
            And music the whole day long,<br/>
            And God! to dwell in the town<br/>
            In these springlike summer days,<br/>
            On my brow an unfading frown<br/>
            And hate in my heart always—<br/>
        <br/>
            A machine out of gear, aye, tired,<br/>
            Yet forced to go on—for I’m hired.<br/>
        <br/>
            Just forced to go on through fear,<br/>
            For every day I must eat<br/>
            And find ugly clothes to wear,<br/>
            And bad shoes to hurt my feet<br/>
            And a shelter for work-drugged sleep!<br/>
            A mere drudge! but what can one do?<br/>
            A man that’s a man cannot weep!<br/>
            Suicide? A quitter? Oh, no!<br/>
        <br/>
            But a slave should never grow tired,<br/>
            Whom the masters have kindly hired.<br/>
        <br/>
            But oh! for the woods, the flowers<br/>
            Of natural, sweet perfume,<br/>
            The heartening, summer showers<br/>
            And the smiling shrubs in bloom,<br/>
            Dust-free, dew-tinted at morn,<br/>
            The fresh and life-giving air,<br/>
            The billowing waves of corn<br/>
            And the birds’ notes rich and clear:—<br/>
        <br/>
            For a man-machine toil-tired<br/>
            May crave beauty too—though he’s hired.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>If We Must Die</h2>
      <p>
            If we must die, let it not be like hogs<br/> 
            Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,<br/>
            While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,<br/>
            Making their mock at our accursèd lot.<br/>
            If we must die, O let us nobly die,<br/>
            So that our precious blood may not be shed<br/>
            In vain; then even the monsters we defy<br/>
            Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!<br/>
            O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!<br/>
            Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,<br/>
            And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!<br/>
            What though before us lies the open grave?<br/>
            Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,<br/>
            Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>Harlem Shadows</h2>
      <p>
            I hear the halting footsteps of a lass<br/> 
            In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall<br/> 
            Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass<br/> 
            To bend and barter at desire's call.<br/> 
            Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet<br/> 
            Go prowling through the night from street to street!<br/>
        <br/>
            Through the long night until the silver break<br/> 
            Of day the little gray feet know no rest;<br/> 
            Through the lone night until the last snow-flake<br/> 
            Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast,<br/> 
            The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet<br/> 
            Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.<br/>
        <br/>
            Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way<br/> 
            Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,<br/> 
            Has pushed the timid little feet of clay,<br/> 
            The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!<br/> 
            Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet<br/> 
            In Harlem wandering from street to street.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>To One Coming North</h2>
      <p>
            At first you'll joy to see the playful snow,<br/> 
            Like white moths trembling on the tropic air,<br/> 
            Or waters of the hills that softly flow<br/> 
            Gracefully falling down a shining stair.<br/>
        <br/>
            And when the fields and streets are covered white<br/> 
            And the wind-worried void is chilly, raw,<br/> 
            Or underneath a spell of heat and light<br/> 
            The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,<br/>
        <br/>
            Like me you'll long for home, where birds' glad song<br/> 
            Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry,<br/> 
            And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong,<br/> 
            Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.<br/>
        <br/>
            But oh! more than the changeless southern isles,<br/> 
            When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm,<br/> 
            You'll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles<br/> 
            By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>The Lynching</h2>
      <p>
            His spirit is smoke ascended to high heaven.<br/>
            His father, by the cruelest way of pain,<br/>
            Had bidden him to his bosom once again;<br/>
            The awful sin remained still unforgiven.<br/>
            All night a bright and solitary star<br/>
            (Perchance the one that ever guided him,<br/>
            Yet gave him up at last to Fate's wild whim)<br/>
            Hung pitifully o'er the swinging char.<br/>
            Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view<br/>
            The ghastly body swaying in the sun:<br/>
            The women thronged to look, but never a one<br/>
            Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue;<br/>
            And little lads, lynchers that were to be,<br/>
            Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
    
      <h2>After the Winter</h2>
      <p>
            Some day, when trees have shed their leaves<br/>
            And against the morning’s white<br/>
            The shivering birds beneath the eaves<br/>
            Have sheltered for the night,<br/>
            We’ll turn our faces southward, love,<br/>
            Toward the summer isle<br/>
            Where bamboos spire the shafted grove<br/>
            And wide-mouthed orchids smile.<br/>
        <br/>
            And we will seek the quiet hill<br/>
            Where towers the cotton tree,<br/>
            And leaps the laughing crystal rill,<br/>
            And works the droning bee.<br/>
            And we will build a cottage there<br/>
            Beside an open glade,<br/>
            With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,<br/>
            And ferns that never fade.<br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
