        <h1>About the Poets</h1>
        <p>Here is some biographical information about the poets featured in our project to provide context for our research with both their individual poems
        and the Harlem Renaissance time period.</p>
        <h2>Arna Bontemps</h2>arna_bontemps.jpeg
        <img src="arna_bontemps.jpeg"/>
        <p> Arna Wendell Bontemps was born on October 13, 1902, in Alexandria, Louisiana, the son of
            a Creole bricklayer and schoolteacher. At age three he and his family moved to Los
            Angeles after his father was threatened by two drunk white men. Bontemps grew up in
            California and was sent to the San Fernando Academy boarding school with his father’s
            instruction to not “go up there acting colored.” This Bontemps later noted as a
            formative moment, and he would resent what he saw as an effort to make him forget his
            heritage. He graduated from Pacific Union College in Angwin in 1923 with an AB.</p>
        <p> In 1924 he accepted a teaching position in Harlem, New York. He married Alberta Johnson,
            a former student, in 1926; they would eventually have six children. Though his original
            plan was to obtain his PhD in English, he accepted teaching positions to support his
            family. Luckily, it was while teaching in Harlem that he would become closely connected
            to the Harlem Renaissance and befriend major artists such as Countee Cullen, W. E. B.
            DuBois, Zora Neale Hurston, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and
            especially Langston Hughes, with whom he frequently collaborated.</p>
        <p> Bontemps first published his poems in Crisis in 1924, and also later
            in Opportunity, both literary magazines that supported the work of young African
            American writers. In 1926 and 1927 Bontemps win three prizes for his poetry from these
            publications. His first book of fiction was God Sends Sunday (1931), the story of a
            fast-living black jockey named Little Augie. The book received mixed reviews: praise for
            its significance as a book by a black author but also criticism for its emphasis on the
            seamier side of black life.</p>
        <p> That same year Bontemps moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where he had accepted a position
            at Oakwood Junior College. In 1932 he received another prize for the short story “A
            Summer Tragedy” and published his first two children’s book, Popo and Fifina: Children
            of Haiti, with Langston Hughes, and You Can’t Pet a Possumin 1934. He began work
            on Black Thunder: Gabriel’s Revolt: Virginia 1800, the story of an aborted slave
            rebellion led by Gabriel Prosser. The novel, published in 1936, was finished in his
            father’s California house. At the end of the 1934 school year Oakwood dismissed
            Bontemps, a reaction to the combination of his radical politics, out-of-state visitors,
            his personal book collection, and the school’s own conservative and religious views.</p>
        <p>In 1943 Bontemps received a master’s degree in library science from the University of
            Chicago. He was appointed a librarian at Fisk University, a position he held until his
            retirement in 1965, followed by honorary degrees and professorships at the University of
            Illinois and Yale University, and a return to Fisk as a writer in residence.</p>
        <p>He died June 4, 1973, from a heart attack, while working on his autobiography.
            Though Sterling A. Brown and Aaron Douglas noted that his writings have not received the
            critical attention deserved, his work as a librarian and historian point to him as a
            great chronicler and a preserver of the documents of black cultural heritage. His
            family’s old Louisiana home is now the Arna Bontemps African American Museum and
            Cultural Arts Center.</p>
        <h2>Claude McKay</h2>
        <img src="cmckay.jpeg"/>
        <p>Claude McKay was born in Jamaica on September 15, 1889. He was educated by his older
            brother, who possessed a library of English novels, poetry, and scientific texts. In
            1912, McKay published a book of verse called Songs of Jamaica (Gardner), recording his
            impressions of black life in Jamaica in dialect. That same year, he traveled to the
            United States to attend Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He remained there only a few
            months, leaving to study agriculture at Kansas State University.</p>
        <p>In 1917, he published two sonnets, “The Harlem Dancer” and “Invocation," and later used
            the form in writing about social and political concerns from his perspective as a black
            man in the United States. McKay also wrote on a variety of subjects, from his Jamaican
            homeland to romantic love, with a use of passionate language.</p>
        <p>During the twenties, McKay developed an interest in Communism and traveled to Russia and
            then to France, where he met Edna St. Vincent Millay and Lewis Sinclair. In 1934, McKay
            moved back to the United States and lived in Harlem, New York. Losing faith in
            Communism, he turned his attention to the teachings of various spiritual and political
            leaders in Harlem, eventually converting to Catholicism.</p>
        <p>McKay’s viewpoints and poetic achievements in the earlier part of the twentieth century
            set the tone for the Harlem Renaissance and gained the deep respect of younger black
            poets of the time, including Langston Hughes. He died on May 22, 1948.</p>
        <h2> James Weldon Johnson</h2>
        <img src="jwjohnson.jpeg"/>
        <p> Born on June 17, 1871 in Jacksonville, Florida, James Weldon Johnson was encouraged by
            his mother to study English literature and the European musical tradition. He attended
            Atlanta University, with the hope that the education he received there could be used to
            further the interests of African Americans. After graduating, he took a job as a high
            school principal in Jacksonville.</p>
        <p>In 1900, he wrote the song “Lift Every Voice and Sing” on the occasion of Lincoln’s
            birthday; the song was immensely popular in the black community, and became known as the
            “Negro National Anthem.” Johnson moved to New York in 1901 to work with his brother
            Rosamond, a composer; after attaining some success as a songwriter for Broadway, he
            decided in 1906 to take a job as a U.S. consul to Venezuela. While employed by the
            diplomatic corps, Johnson had poems published in The Century Magazine and The
            Independent.</p>
        <p>In 1912, Johnson anonymously published his novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored
            Man (French and Co.), the story of a musician who rejects his black roots for a life of
            material comfort in the white world. The book explores the issue of racial identity in
            the twentieth century, a common theme for the writers of the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
        <p>With his talent for persuading people of differing ideologies to work together for a
            common goal, Johnson became the national organizer for the National Association for the
            Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1920. He edited The Book of American Negro
            Poetry (Harcourt Brace, 1922), a major contribution to the history of African-American
            literature. His book of poetry  God’s Trombones (Viking Press, 1927) was influenced by
            his impressions of the rural South, drawn from a trip he took to Georgia while a
            freshman in college. It was this trip that ignited his interest in the African American
            folk tradition.James Weldon Johnson died on June 26, 1938.</p>
        <h2>Langston Hughes</h2>
        <img src="LangstonHuges_.jpeg"/>
        <p> James Mercer Langston Hughes was born February 1, 1902, in Joplin, Missouri. His parents divorced when he was a young child, and his father moved to Mexico. 
            He was raised by his grandmother until he was thirteen, when he moved to Lincoln, Illinois, to live with his mother and her husband, before the family eventually 
            settled in Cleveland, Ohio. It was in Lincoln that Hughes began writing poetry. After graduating from high school, he spent a year in Mexico followed by a year at Columbia 
            University in New York City. During this time, he held odd jobs such as assistant cook, launderer, and busboy. He also travelled to Africa and Europe working as a seaman. 
            In November 1924, he moved to Washington, D. C. Hughes’s first book of poetry, The Weary Blues, (Knopf, 1926) was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1926. He finished his college
            education at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania three years later. In 1930 his first novel, Not Without Laughter, (Knopf, 1930) won the Harmon gold medal for literature.</p>
            
            <p>Hughes, who claimed Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Carl Sandburg, and Walt Whitman as his primary influences, is particularly known for his insightful, colorful portrayals of black life 
                in America from the twenties through the sixties. He wrote novels, short stories and plays, as well as poetry, and is also known for his engagement with the world of jazz and the 
                influence it had on his writing, as in his book-length poem Montage of a Dream Deferred (Holt, 1951). His life and work were enormously important in shaping the artistic contributions 
                of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. Unlike other notable black poets of the period—Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and Countee Cullen—Hughes refused to differentiate between his personal 
                experience and the common experience of black America. He wanted to tell the stories of his people in ways that reflected their actual culture, including both their suffering and their 
                love of music, laughter, and language itself.</p>
            
            <p>The critic Donald B. Gibson noted in the introduction to Modern Black Poets: A Collection of Critical Essays (Prentice Hall, 1973) that Hughes “differed from most of his predecessors among 
                black poets . . . in that he addressed his poetry to the people, specifically to black people. During the twenties when most American poets were turning inward, writing obscure and esoteric 
                poetry to an ever decreasing audience of readers, Hughes was turning outward, using language and themes, attitudes and ideas familiar to anyone who had the ability simply to read . . . Until the 
                time of his death, he spread his message humorously—though always seriously—to audiences throughout the country, having read his poetry to more people (possibly) than any other American poet.”</p>
            
            <p>In addition to leaving us a large body of poetic work, Hughes wrote eleven plays and countless works of prose, including the well-known “Simple” books: Simple Speaks His Mind, (Simon and Schuster, 1950);
                 Simple Stakes a Claim, (Rinehart, 1957); Simple Takes a Wife, (Simon and Schuster, 1953); and Simple’s Uncle Sam (Hill and Wang, 1965). He edited the anthologies The Poetry of the Negro and The Book of Negro 
                Folklore, wrote an acclaimed autobiography, The Big Sea (Knopf, 1940), and cowrote the play Mule Bone (HarperCollins, 1991) with Zora Neale Hurston.</p>    
            
            <p>Langston Hughes died of complications from prostate cancer on May 22, 1967, in New York City. In his memory, his residence at 20 East 127th Street in Harlem has been given landmark status by the New York City
                Preservation Commission, and East 127th Street has been renamed “Langston Hughes Place.”</p>
