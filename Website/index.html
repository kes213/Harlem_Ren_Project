        <p>This webpage is dedicated to the Harlem Renaissance Poetry Project! On this site, you'll find biographical information about Harlem Renaissance poets 
        that our project team finds interesting and influential, as well as poems written by these poets during this important time period in African American history!</p>
        <p>Stay tuned, as this website is in progress! Biographical information and poem analyses are the future of our project! Check back daily for updates and changes
        that we will make!</p>

          <h3>Key Poem Elements for Analysis:</h3>
           <p>**A Working List**</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poem Form ~ How many lines are present in each poem? Are there stanzas, and if so, how many, with how many lines ine each?</li>
                <li>Punctuation ~ Which puncuation marks are used most often among these poets?</li>
                <li>Figurative Language ~ Does the poet use any figurative language? If so, what forms of figurative language are most common?</li>
            </ul>
          <p>We hope that, by looking at a cluster of individual poems by Harlem Renaissance poets, we can generalize our findings and discover patterns and trends for this time period.</p>
