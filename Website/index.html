        <p>This webpage is dedicated to the Harlem Renaissance Poetry Project! On this site, you'll find biographical information about Harlem Renaissance poets 
        that our project team finds interesting and influential, as well as poems written by these poets during this important time period in African American history!</p>
        <p>This project was developed for the Digital Humanities</p>

          <h3>Key Poem Elements for Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Punctuation ~ Which puncuation marks are used most often among these poets?</li>
                <li>Figurative Language ~ Does the poet use any figurative language? If so, what forms of figurative language are most common?</li>
            </ul>
          <p>We hope that, by looking at a cluster of individual poems by Harlem Renaissance poets, we can generalize our findings and discover patterns and trends for this time period.</p>
