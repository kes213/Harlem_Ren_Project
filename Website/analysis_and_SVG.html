        <p>The Harlem Renaissance Poetry Project's goal was to analyze two key elements of poetry written during the Harlem Renaissance time period: a time in 
        American history where African American culture thrived and grew in new and outspoken ways.</p>
        <p>This project analyzed punctuation usage among the most famous poems by each of the poets in our poetry collection. We looked at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Commas</li>
            <li>Periods</li>
            <li>Semicolons</li>
            <li>Colons</li>
            <li>Exclamation Points</li>
            <li>Question Marks</li>
            <li>Open and Closed Parenthesis</li>
            <li>Dashes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We counted the number of times each was used, and found that the top three -- commas, periods, and semicolons -- showed the most significant numbers. 
        We converted those numbers to percenages, depicted in the graphs below.</p>
